Here are clear and efficient notes about the components of LangChain based on the sources provided and our conversation history:
•
Core Components of LangChain
◦
LangChain acts as an assembly line, linking various processes (models, chat models, prompts, databases, calls) into a unified workflow.
◦
The key components discussed in the sources are Chat Models, Chains, Rags (Retrieval Augmented Generation), and Agents and Tools. Prompt Templates are also introduced as a core component.
•
Chat Models
◦
Chat models provide an interface to communicate with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Hugging Face models, or Claude Sonnet APIs.
◦
They allow communication with LLMs in a structured way.
◦
LangChain offers different chat model classes for providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini, making it easy to switch between models.
◦
The invoke method is used to make API calls to the LLM.
◦
You can pass a simple string or a list of messages to the invoke method.
◦
Types of Messages in LangChain are essential for sending conversation history:
▪
System Message: Defines the AI's role and context, typically at the beginning. Example: "You are an expert in social media content strategy".
▪
Human Message: Represents user input or questions. Example: "Give a short tip to create engaging posts on Instagram".
▪
AI Message: Contains the AI's responses. Example: "focus on social media engagement".
◦
Sending past conversation history using these message types in a list is crucial for building real-world applications where the AI needs context awareness.
◦
Conversation history can be stored locally in memory (in a variable), but for production applications, it should be persisted in the cloud (like Firebase Firestore) to continue conversations across sessions.
•
Prompt Templates
◦
Prompt templates are a core component.
◦
They enable creating strings with placeholder values (like {company}, {position}) that can be replaced with custom inputs.
◦
This is useful for generating varied outputs based on parameters, such as generating different emails.
◦
The ChatPromptTemplate class converts a template string (using from_template) or a list of message tuples (like ("system", "..."), ("human", "...")) (using from_messages) into a format LangChain understands.
◦
The invoke method is used on the prompt template to populate the placeholders with actual values.
◦
The output of invoking a prompt template is often a list of messages in the format expected by LLMs.
•
Chains
◦
Chains are used to connect multiple tasks together, creating a unified workflow.
◦
They divide complex processes into smaller steps, passing the output of one step as the input to the next.
◦
Using chains simplifies code and improves readability compared to performing tasks separately.
◦
The pipe operator (|) is the simple way to chain different tasks (called runnables).
◦
Inputs passed to the beginning of a chain are available across all subsequent runnables in that chain.
◦
Under the hood, chains can be built using runnable_sequence and runnable_lambda. A runnable_lambda wraps a Python function as a reusable unit.
◦
Types of Chaining:
▪
Extended or Sequential: Tasks run one after the other linearly. Example: Format prompt, send to model, parse response, translate.
▪
Parallel: Multiple chains/tasks run simultaneously and independently. Results can be combined afterwards. Useful for generating multiple outputs in parallel. Managed by runnable_parallel. Example: Get movie summary, then run plot analysis and character analysis chains in parallel.
▪
Conditional: Workflow branches based on a condition, directing flow to one specific chain out of options. Acts like a switch case. Useful for routing based on criteria. Example: Route customer support feedback based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, escalate).
•
Rags (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
◦
RAGs are a critical technology for increasing productivity.
◦
Problem Solved: Provides LLMs with additional, external knowledge they weren't trained on, like private documents or databases. This enables more accurate answers on specific, non-public data.
◦
Problem Solved: Addresses the context window limit of LLMs by retrieving and providing only the relevant sections of documents based on the user's query, instead of trying to input entire large documents.
◦
A RAG system combines an LLM with a retrieval system that searches external information sources.
◦
RAG Workflow Components:
▪
Ingestion (Part 1 - Preparing Data): Takes large documents/text collections and prepares them for searching.
•
Loading Documents: Load the text.
•
Chunking: Split large documents into smaller, manageable pieces (chunks). Necessary due to LLM token limits.
•
Chunk Overlap: Include overlapping text between chunks to preserve context.
•
Metadata: Add information (e.g., source document name) to chunks to indicate origin.
•
Embeddings: Convert text chunks into vector embeddings (mathematical representations of meaning) using an embedding model (like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small).
•
Vector Store/Database: Store the vector embeddings and their corresponding original text chunks. Vector databases enable searching based on meaning (semantic similarity). ChromaDB is used as an example for local storage.
▪
Retrieval & Generation (Part 2 - Answering Query): Uses the prepared data to answer user questions.
•
Convert the user's question into a vector embedding using the same embedding model used for document chunks.
•
Retriever: Takes the user's question embedding and queries the vector store to find the most relevant document chunks.
•
Configurable via search type (similarity_score_threshold) and number of top chunks to retrieve (e.g., k=3). Similarity scores are typically 0-1.
•
The vector store quickly returns the top relevant chunks based on similarity.
•
Send both the original user question (plain text) and the retrieved relevant document chunks (plain text) to the LLM.
•
The LLM uses the provided chunks as additional context to reason and generate an informed answer. The LLM can be instructed to answer only based on the provided documents.
•
The final answer can include information found within the private documents.
◦
RAG systems enable chatting with your own data in natural language.
◦
They can be seen as giving LLMs long-term memory.
•
Agents and Tools
◦
Agents are AI decision-makers that can look at a problem and decide which tools to use to solve it autonomously.
◦
Unlike chains or RAG, agents can decide their own steps.
◦
Agents can interact with APIs, send emails, scrape data, run scripts, query databases, and more. Example: An agent booking a meeting could check a calendar, send an invite, and update a CRM.
◦
Tools: Specific functions or abilities an AI agent can use. They are the "special abilities" given to agents. Examples: calculator, search engine, calendar, or custom functions.
◦
A standard Python function can be turned into a LangChain tool using the @tool decorator.
◦
A docstring (description) for the tool function is mandatory and crucial for the LLM to understand its purpose and decide when to use it.
◦
The agent's execution often follows a cycle of Thought/Reasoning, Action, Observation, and Repeat. This cycle continues until the agent solves the problem.
◦
The React (Reason + Act) prompt is an example format that guides the LLM through this loop. It explicitly prompts the LLM to think, decide on an action (tool name, input), observe the tool's output, and repeat or provide the final answer.
◦
The LLM within the agent does not directly execute the tools. It suggests which tools to call and their arguments based on its reasoning.
◦
The LangChain framework intercepts the LLM's suggestion, calls the corresponding Python tool function with the suggested arguments, and sends the tool's output back to the LLM for further processing.
◦
The agent_executor class executes the agent, managing the interaction between the LLM and tools.
◦
Setting verbose=True shows the agent's reasoning and actions in the logs, which is useful for debugging.
◦
Providing custom tools (like a calculator) is often safer in production even if the LLM might be able to perform simple tasks itself, ensuring reliability
